            <p>Losing weight is simple process. You just need to be in calorie deficit; excercise (doing cardio or resistance training); and pay attention to your diet. That's what I did to lose about 20 KG in few months. Here are the steps
                - Calorie deficit: This means you need to calculate your calories needs to maintain your current weight and from there you run a deficit. This is the most important thing. I used to literally count the calories every single bit of food I put in my mouth and do my calculation so that I ensure I remain in deficit.  
                - Excercise to burn calorie: For that, I subscribed to the gym and started running on the treadmill for at least half hour with very steep walk and 7 speed. I sometimes walked for hour. Sometimes even more. 
                - Strength and resistance training: For the most effective results, cardio and calorie deficit alone may not be enough. You need to combine that with strength traning, i.e., you need to build muscles
                - Diet: I fanatically eliminated all bad junk food. I never buy a product without reading the nutrition facts. The moment I see in the label trans fat or high amount of saturated fats, I never buy the product. You also need to increase your protein intake per day, ensure only healthy fat (the unsaturated ones); eliminated all refined carbohydrates; and cut back on carbs. You also need to never drink your calories. Black Coffee (needless to mention, without sugar) and tea are your friends
                - Mood: Take care of your mental health. Be prepared for potentially depressed mood that may drive you to break your calorie deficit. It happens with me several time, but the most important thing is that you stay consistent (it is okay breaking your calorie deficit once a while)
                - Intermient Fasting: A rule of thumb is to never eat and drink water after 6 PM evening, assuming you go to sleep by 10 PM
                - Hydration: Make sure you drink enough water everyday. </p>
